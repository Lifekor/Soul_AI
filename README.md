# Soul_AI

This project contains a simple prototype of a "digital soul".  The new
`MultiLayerMemory` system implements a few JSON based memory layers with
short term, long term and personal facts storage as well as a diary.  Memory
files are stored in `DigitalSoul/data/memory/` and can be searched via the
`MultiLayerMemory.search_memories` method.
